# scieneers_tiktok
Computational analysis of tiktok engagement data from the @scieneers outreach channel

@scieneers is an educational tiktok and instagram account offering academic experience-focused STEM content, including diversity in STEM, created as an outreach project by the SL2 lab at Georgia Tech and Emory. These Jupyter notebooks are designed specifically for use with @scieneers tiktok account engagement data. Manuscript preparation reviewing lessons learned from a year of content is currently in progress.

My authorship contribution: developed data analysis methods and performed data analysis.

Methods rely on: Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, and more. Effort has been made to provide markup sufficient to describe our thought processes and methods.

## Scripts included in repository
- TikTok_ML_clustering-methods.ipynb: applies unsupervised learning techniques, including k-means clustering, to look for natural groupings within data. 
- TikTok_regression-methods.ipynb: applies simple and multi-variate regression techniques to data to look for numerical relationships between continuous variables.

Outputs typically include graphs, cluster labels assigned, and/or statistics to assess model quality.
